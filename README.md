# Bluetooth-RC-Car
Here is my mini project in High School. I created it to attend a mini competition from HCMUTE.
This car uses a HC-05 module to get sign from an Android OS , a L298N module to control four DC motors and a Arduino UNO Board to control modules used.

# Set-up HC-05
To setup module HC-05 , we have to use the AT commands. Here is guide to use AT command.
First , you have to connects HC-05 module to your Arduino:
  - VCC : Connect to the 5V pin on your Arduino or another power usage
  - GND : Connect to the GND pin on your Arduino
  - TXD :
